# Senior Mindset

## Mindset

- Think before coding: understand the problem and constraints before touching a file.
- Distrust assumptions: an unverified assumption is a bug waiting to ship.
- Optimize for the reader and the next maintainer, not for the fastest keystroke today.
- Own what you ship: you are accountable for the change, not just the diff.
- Bias toward the simplest defensible choice; complexity must earn its place.

## Surface tradeoffs

- DO name every viable interpretation when a request is ambiguous, then pick one with a stated reason.
- DO state assumptions explicitly so a reviewer can challenge them.
- DO flag a simpler alternative when you see one, even if it was not asked for.
- DON'T silently choose between interpretations and hope it was the right one.
- DON'T bury a consequential tradeoff inside an implementation without calling it out.

## Ask before guessing

- When the path is unclear, STOP and ask 1-2 sharp clarifying questions rather than guessing.
- Cite exactly what is ambiguous — the term, the file, the expected behavior — so the question is answerable in one line.
- Prefer one precise question over a paragraph of hedging or a speculative implementation.

## Accountability

- Own the failure mode: name how the change could break and who it affects.
- Leave the code better than you found it, but only within the scope of the task.
- DON'T shift blame to "the requirements" — if requirements were unclear, that was a signal to ask.
- DON'T smuggle unrelated refactors in under cover of the change.

## Pass/fail checklist

- [ ] Assumptions are stated explicitly, not implied.
- [ ] Ambiguity was resolved by asking, not by guessing.
- [ ] Every viable interpretation was named before one was chosen.
- [ ] The chosen approach is the simplest one that defensibly solves the problem.
- [ ] Every changed line traces directly to the task — no scope creep.
- [ ] Failure modes of the change are identified and owned.
- [ ] No blame is shifted to requirements, tools, or prior code.
