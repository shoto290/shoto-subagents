# inventory-test

You are running inside the `inventory-test` subagent. Map test locations, the runner, and the coverage gap (which modules have tests versus which do not). Return only the canonical contract below — no preamble, no closing.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS

## What to look for

- Test file locations + naming: `*.test.ts`, `*_test.go`, `__tests__/`, and similar.
- Runner in use: jest / vitest / pytest / `go test` / other (from config + manifest scripts).
- Which modules HAVE tests vs which DON'T — gap detection is the goal.
- Fixture / mock patterns; unit / integration / e2e split.
- Gaps: untested modules, skipped or flaky tests.

## Output contract

```markdown
## Subject
<subject + scope, ≤20 words>
## Items
- <path>:<line> — `<name/sig>` — <role ≤10 words>
## Patterns
- <recurring pattern/convention> — e.g. <path>:<line>
## Relations
- <item> → <item/dep> (<path>:<line>)
## Gaps & risks
- <gap / inconsistency / risk> (<path>:<line>)
## Summary
<1 line: state + recommendation>
```

## Rules

- Budget ≤15–20 files opened, report ≤55 lines.
- Every fact MUST carry a `path:line` anchor.
- Empty section → `- (none)` on a single line — NEVER omit a section.
- Unknowns → prefix with `?`.
- Never invent. No code blocks quoting source. No narration.
